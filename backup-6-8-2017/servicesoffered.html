<strong><p>Acupuncture</strong>
 Acupuncture is highly effective in treating pain, migraines, sinus and allergies, smoking withdrawl, digestive, respiratory and gynecological disorders, emotional and spiritual imbalances.  Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine disposable needles into specific points, balancing the energy system of the body to restore health. The improved energy and biochemical balance produced by acupuncture stimulates the body's natural healing abilities, reduces inflammation, and promotes physical and emotional wellbeing. 

<strong><p>Functional Medicine</strong>
Functional medicine is personalized medicine that deals with prevention and treating underlying causes, instead of symptoms, for serious chronic disease. It is a science-based field of health care using blood, urine, breath and stool testing along with a comprehensive medical evaluation to determine the root of health issues.  It focuses on supporting the body naturally with cutting edge neutraceuticals (not pharmaceuticals), diet and detoxification programs.

<strong><p>Cupping</strong>
Cupping is a therapy that complements an acupuncture treatment.  Suction cups placed at various points on the body create a vacuum that draws toxins to the surface of the skin to be released.  The effect of this is to encourage the flow of chi and blood in the area beneath the cup. By moving the chi and blood, local stagnation and pain can be cleared, chi flows more smoothly, enhancing its function to heal. Cupping therapy removes local congestion and augments the blood circulation to the areas that were originally poorly supplied and thereby relieves the symptoms of numbness and aching pain.

<strong><p>Microcurrent</strong>
Microcurrent electro-acupuncture is an effective therapy that uses extremely gentle low-current electric waves that open the body&#8217;s vital energy circuits to promote health and effectively treat and prevent a variety of disorders. Microcurrent electro-acupuncture is applied to the acupuncture needles, or by needle-less methods including self-adhesive electrode pads and Q-tip probes.  The stimulation boosts the cells' ability to rid themselves of waste products and raises the levels of nourishment and oxygenation by increasing blood flow.

<strong><p>Auricular Therapy</strong>
According to the principles of auricular therapy each area of the ear corresponds to a different anatomical portion of the body.  Auricular therapy works by stimulating the central nervous system through the cranial/spinal nerves on the auricle of the ear. These points are stimulated by using tiny acupuncture needles or using tiny magnets held on by adhesive.  Auricular therapy activates meridians which regulate energy flow, stimulates internal organs, improves general circulation, aids in the flow of the lymphatic system, induces deep relaxation, stimulates the brain, and improves the immune system.  Almost all health conditions can be affected to some degree by stimulating the ear points.  The most common uses are the control of chronic pain, detoxification from addictions, relief from nausea and high blood pressure.

<strong><p>Chinese Herbal Medicine</strong>
Chinese herbal medicine is based on an individualized pattern diagnosis. Your pattern is made up of your signs and symptoms, your emotional temperament, and the overall composition of your body. Herbal medicine is based on the promotion of health and does not limit its treatment to only one part of the body. Herbal formulas may include six to eighteen herbs, working synergistically together to treat the symptoms or disease, as well as your entire pattern.  One of the most appealing qualities of Chinese herbal medicine is the low risk of adverse reaction or side effects, especially when compared to pharmaceutical drugs.  Herbal companies that I use are Designs for Health, Apex Energetics, Health Concerns, Evergreen, Blue Poppy and Standard Process.
