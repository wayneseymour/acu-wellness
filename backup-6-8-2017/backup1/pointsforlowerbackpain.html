<p>Most all acupuncture treatments involve a pulse rate diagnosis. For this reason, two patients may have pain in the same area with very different causes. For some people, it can be strange to have needles inserted into parts of the body far away from the location of the pain, but these points are located on the meridians that need to be balanced in order for the back pain to be alleviated. For example, lower back pain may be caused by a lack of energy in the kidney meridian, which could involve an acupuncture needle in the ankle. Frequently, acupuncture needles are placed in points on the forearms, hands, and legs when lower back pain is being treated. Needles may also be placed on the front of the body, as well as the back.</p>
&#65533;
<p>Just as with infertility, herbs are often used to assist in alleviating lower back pain. These herbs are believed to increase Qi and blood flow to the area of the lower back, and, of course, they balance the flow of energy through the meridians. The acupuncturist/herbologist would prescribe specific herbs based on the meridians most in need, as discovered through the pulse rate and other diagnostic techniques.</p>
&#65533;
<p>The most common diagnoses for lower back pain are Qi and blood stagnation, often caused by trauma to the area and kidney deficiency. Patients with Qi and blood stagnation are often treated with needles in points along the bladder meridian, while patients with kidney deficiency are most likely to be treated with needles in points along the kidney meridian.</p>

<p>Lower back pain is considered to be one of the conditions that responds best to acupuncture, and millions of people are treated every year with various methods of acupuncture.
