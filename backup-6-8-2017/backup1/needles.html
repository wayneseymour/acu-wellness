<strong><p>Acupuncture</strong>
 Acupuncture is highly effective in treating pain, migraines, sinus and allergies, smoking withdrawl, digestive, respiratory and gynecological disorders, emotional and spiritual imbalances.  Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine disposable needles into specific points, balancing the energy system of the body to restore health. The improved energy and biochemical balance produced by acupuncture stimulates the body's natural healing abilities, reduces inflammation, and promotes physical and emotional wellbeing. 

<strong><p>Functional Medicine</strong>
Functional medicine is personalized medicine that deals with prevention and treating underlying causes, instead of symptoms, for serious chronic disease. It is a science-based field of health care using blood, saliva and stool testing along with a comprehensive medical evaluation to determine the root of health issues.  It focuses on supporting the body naturally with cutting edge neutraceuticals (not pharmaceuticals), diet and detoxification programs.

<strong><p>Cupping</strong>
Cupping is a therapy that complements an acupuncture treatment.  Suction cups placed at various points on the body create a vacuum that draws toxins to the surface of the skin to be released.  The effect of this is to encourage the flow of chi and blood in the area beneath the cup. By moving the chi and blood, local stagnation and pain can be cleared, chi flows more smoothly, enhancing its function to heal. Cupping therapy removes local congestion and augments the blood circulation to the areas that were originally poorly supplied and thereby relieves the symptoms of numbness and aching pain.

<strong><p>Microcurrent</strong>
Microcurrent electro-acupuncture is an effective therapy that uses extremely gentle low-current electric waves that open the body&#8217;s vital energy circuits to promote health and effectively treat and prevent a variety of disorders. Microcurrent electro-acupuncture is applied to the acupuncture needles, or by needle-less methods including self-adhesive electrode pads and Q-tip probes.  The stimulation boosts the cells' ability to rid themselves of waste products and raises the levels of nourishment and oxygenation by increasing blood flow.

<strong><p>Auricular Therapy</strong>
According to the principles of auricular therapy each area of the ear corresponds to a different anatomical portion of the body.  Auricular therapy works by stimulating the central nervous system through the cranial/spinal nerves on the auricle of the ear. These points are stimulated by using tiny acupuncture needles or using tiny magnets held on by adhesive.  Auricular therapy activates meridians which regulate energy flow, stimulates internal organs, improves general circulation, aids in the flow of the lymphatic system, induces deep relaxation, stimulates the brain, and improves the immune system.  Almost all health conditions can be affected to some degree by stimulating the ear points.  The most common uses are the control of chronic pain, detoxification from addictions, relief from nausea and high blood pressure.

<strong><p>Chinese Herbal Medicine</strong>
Chinese herbal medicine is based on an individualized pattern diagnosis. Your pattern is made up of your signs and symptoms, your emotional temperament, and the overall composition of your body. Herbal medicine is based on the promotion of health and does not limit its treatment to only one part of the body. Herbal formulas may include six to eighteen herbs, working synergistically together to treat the symptoms or disease, as well as your entire pattern.  One of the most appealing qualities of Chinese herbal medicine is the low risk of adverse reaction or side effects, especially when compared to pharmaceutical drugs.  Herbal companies that I use are Apex Energetics, Health Concerns, Evergreen, Blue Poppy and Standard Process.

<strong><p>Saliva Testing</strong>

Saliva is used to evaluate the nuances that may not show in blood work- how many times have you heard &#8220;blood work normal&#8221; yet you have every sign and symptom that clearly shows you are not functioning normally.  Saliva testing is convenient, non-invasive and inexpensive, which allows for needed multiple tests over an extended period of time to design individual healing programs.  Saliva tests the free hormones, which are the correct reflection of the bio-activity of the hormones available for the body to use.  Testing is performed in the comfort of your own home and results are in our office approximately 1 week after you send them in.  We use Diagnos-Techs labs out of Washington. This lab has been awarded accreditation by the Joint Commission for standards. Costs: $75-300

<strong><p>Blood Testing<br></strong> 

Chances are that you have an insurance plan which dictates which blood tests are &#8220;medically necessary&#8221;. Because allopathic medicine and the insurance system are set up to look only for pathology, tests which assess general physiological function in absence of clear evidence of pathology are usually considered to be unnecessary.  Sometimes, the tests your insurance company will authorize are simply not comprehensive enough to determine what is really going on.  We order the tests we need to look for sub-clinical functional disorders, rather than ordering tests simply to confirm the presence of disease.  While this may cost you more money in the short run, it provides significantly more information which we can use to find the root of your complaints rather than providing a band-aid solution.  Blood work is ordered through Labcorp.


<strong><p>GI Stool Testing<br></strong>

If you are having chronic and vague GI symptoms &#8211;frequent bloating, gas, cramping, diarrhea and constipation, travel within the U.S. and overseas, close living quarters, children in daycare.<br><br>


GI Effects Stool Profiles done through Metametrix go beyond "old stool technology" to bring you the most comprehensive stool analysis to date. GI Effects Profiles use DNA analysis to identify microbiota, including anaerobes, a previously immeasurable area of the gut environment. In addition to much more comprehensive bacteriology, mycology, and parasitology, GI Effects Profiles report drug resistance genes, antibiotic and botanical sensitivities, gliadin-specific sIgA, Elastase1, plus other inflammation, digestion, and absorption markers clinicians need, with only one specimen collection.



<strong><p>Gluten Testing<br></strong> 

EnteroLab is a registered and fully accredited clinical laboratory specializing in the analysis of intestinal specimens for food sensitivities (reactions by the immune system to common proteins in the diet) that cause a variety of symptoms and diseases. One particular area of our focus relates to intestinal conditions caused by immune reactivity to a protein called gluten which is found in wheat, barley, rye, and oats. Recent research in our laboratory indicates that immune sensitivity to gluten is exceedingly common, present in 30-60% of all Americans. Although these reactions can cause malnutrition, growth failure in children, osteoporosis, many autoimmune diseases (including colitis, diabetes, arthritis, and many others), most of the affected individuals are unaware they have it because there have been no sensitive tests capable of diagnosis. Similar sensitivity to yeast in the diet has been linked to the development of an inflammatory intestinal disease called Crohn's disease.
